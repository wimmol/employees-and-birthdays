## Test project for Yalantis React.js School #5
This is a simple React App that builds on functional components, with hooks and requests to a server.

It shows a list of employees, the list has got from the request. This app sorts employees by their first name and splits them into categories with the same first letters of names. On each card of an employee, we have 2 radio buttons, so a user can change the status of the employee to active and back(active users have a blue name). Then there is the right part of the page, where is birthdays list of active employees, they are sorted by month of their birts and in month block sorted by the last name. 

The app is hosted on GitHub Pages: [ClickðŸ‘ˆ](https://wimmol.github.io/employees-and-birthdays/)
